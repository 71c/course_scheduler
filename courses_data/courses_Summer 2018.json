First, computer science is fundamentally concerned with the problem-solving methodologies it derives from its foundational fields: the design principles of engineering, mathematical theory, and scientific empirical study. Second, these methodologies are applied in the complex context of a modern day computing system. In this course we will address both of these important aspects. As a means for developing your design skills, we will discuss the fundamental features of a high level, general purpose programming language — namely C++ — and learn how to use it as a tool for problem solving. We will also consider the performance of solutions, and how to apply both analytical and empirical assessment techniques. Finally, we will explore the Unix operating system as a context for problem solving. (Additional weekly lab time scheduled at first class meeting.)\r\nRecommendations: High school algebra.

Unlike any other field, genetics represents a true integration between the basic and the clinical sciences. The overall course objectives are 1) Given a clinical problem, take an appropriate family history; 2)Given a pedigree, determine the most likely mode of inheritance; 3) Given a disorder, whether Mendelian, chromosomal, or multifactorial in origin, determine the likely risk for other family members; 4) Recognize who might benefit from genetic counseling and provide it if the problem is straightforward, or know to whom to refer patients if the problem is complex; 5) Appreciate how a disease gene is localized, learn the potential benefits of understanding the molecular approach to disease, and appreciate the therapy that can derive from this understanding; 6) Take into account the diversity in genetic makeup as an important factor in preventive health care, diagnosis and treatment; 7) Reduce unnecessary exposure to known and potential physical and chemical mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic agents; 8) Recognize how environment can affect phenotype; 9) Identify ethical dilemmas in providing genetic services.","showCourse":"Y","acad_career":"PDPR","course_title":"Genetics","level1_groupid":"126870S120000000","hasHiddenClasses":"N","comp_reqd_desc":"","course_num":"MBS-0212","sections":[{"components":[{"unit_selected":1.5,"enrl_cart_stat":"N","section_num":"EXM-LEC","unit_min":1.5,"showClass":"Y","campus":"Boston","class_stat":"A","session_desc":"S12","consent":"D","class_num":"50442","assoc_flag":"A","component":"Lecture","class_attr":"MBS Required Courses","grd_basis":"GRD","credit_select":"N","ssr_comp":"LEC","unit_max":1.5,"grd_desc":"GRD","locations":[{"myLocUniqueId":"MBS-021250442EXM-LECTBA","instructor":"Janet M.

These presentations provide students with presentation experience, training in consolidation of clinical cases into teaching objects, and an opportunity to address challenging clinical questions from peers.\nThe two formative PACKRAT Examinations provide detailed content feedback for individual students as well as class performance benchmarked against the national cohort taking the examinations. Similarly, summative examinations such as the Comprehensive Examination and OSCE offer similar content feedback on student performance as well as performance as a cohort. Utilizing these results to pinpoint content or performance deficiencies, Principal Faculty will produce a customized board review lecture series designed to address cohort deficiencies in preparation for clinical practice and the national board examination (PANCE).\nThe OSCE results will also permit faculty to identify procedural and skill deficiencies in students and allow for individualized remediation sessions during the final weeks of the curriculum.\nUtilizing the feedback from the OSCEs, Formative and Summative examinations, the final 4 weeks of the curriculum will be structured to include focused lectures on specific medical topics.","showCourse":"Y","acad_career":"PDPR","course_title":"Integration Seminar","level1_groupid":"142540PA20000000","hasHiddenClasses":"N","comp_reqd_desc":"","course_num":"PA-0260","sections":[{"components":[{"unit_selected":0,"enrl_cart_stat":"N","section_num":"01-SEM","unit_min":0,"showClass":"Y","campus":"Boston","class_stat":"A","session_desc":"PA2","consent":"I","class_num":"50920","assoc_flag":"A","component":"Seminar","class_attr":"PA Required Courses","grd_basis":"PFH","credit_select":"N","ssr_comp":"SEM","unit_max":0,"grd_desc":"PFH","locations":[{"myLocUniqueId":"PA-02605092001-SEMTBA","instructor":"Beth Buyea, Joseph P.
