As a means for developing your design skills, we will discuss the fundamental features of a high level, general purpose programming language — namely C++ — and learn how to use it as a tool for problem solving. We will also consider the performance of solutions, and how to apply both analytical and empirical assessment techniques. Finally, we will explore the Unix operating system as a context for problem solving. (Additional weekly lab time scheduled at first class meeting.)\r\nRecommendations: High school algebra.

National assessments of adult literacy have raised serious concerns about the ability of nearly half the adult population in the U.S. to access and use health information and services (NALS 1992, NAAL 2003, PIAAC 2012). Low health literacy is a barrier to effective health communication, affects health care quality and contributes to health disparities. To address these issues the Institute of Medicine calls for increasing \"knowledge, awareness, and responsiveness to health literacy among health service providers\" (IOM 2005). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that health service providers be trained in health literacy, plain language, and culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS) and use those skills to create patienti-centered best practices (DHHS, 2010).\n\nTo raise awareness among health professionals regarding health literacy as a public health priority, the Health Communication Program at the Tufts University School of Medicine offers a skills oriented seminar in health literacy. This course explores the link between literacy, language and culture and how systems barriers impact access to health information and quality health care services. Students practice writing and speaking in plain language, and consider how to apply health literacy research to practice.

For each topic, participants will learn why the topic is hot or controversial, and will gain an appreciation of the current state of scientific evidence as well as gaps in knowledge.

Healthcare-related issues, such as the nature of healthcare systems, the social determinants of health, shifting demographics and the challenges of healthcare access are multiple, complex and they represent one of the greatest challenges of our time. This course will employ a complex system perspective to cover topics like healthcare policy, healthcare systems design and the essentials of healthcare management from a wide range of models, cultures and settings. From this perspective, the evolving relationships between patients, physicians, hospitals, insurers, employers, communities, and government will be explored. The role of nutrition science and nutrition delivery will also be examined within this framework. The intensive one-week course will call for the active participation of all class members through engagement in individual and group activities, debates and discussions. Students will be assigned reading to be completed in advance of the course. Students will complete daily assignments and a final project that will be due after completion of the week-long course. No prerequisites.Community and Alumni Discounts are not available for this course.","showCourse":"Y","acad_career":"NUTR","course_title":"Complex Sys Approach Hlth Nutr","level1_groupid":"1419590SO0000000","hasHiddenClasses":"N","comp_reqd_desc":"","course_num":"NUTR-0287","sections":[{"components":[{"unit_selected":0.5,"enrl_cart_stat":"N","section_num":"01-LEC","unit_min":0.5,"showClass":"Y","campus":"Boston","class_stat":"A","session_desc":"SOTH","consent":"D","class_num":"50357","assoc_flag":"A","component":"Lecture","class_attr":"","grd_basis":"GRD","credit_select":"N","ssr_comp":"LEC","unit_max":0.5,"grd_desc":"GRD","locations":[{"myLocUniqueId":"NUTR-02875035701-LECB008_118","instructor":"Gabriel Ernesto Novick","campus":"Boston","class_loc":"Jaharis Center, Room 118","meetings":[{"mtg_num":"1","meet_end_min":720,"days":["Mo","Tu","We","Th","Fr"],"meet_end":"12:00PM","meet_start_min":480,"meet_start":"8:00AM"}],"loc_id":"B008_118"}],"assoc_class":"1","selected":"","status":"O"}],"comp_desc":"Lecture"}]},{"desc_long":"This course is designed to introduce students to the theory and practice of entrepreneurship that is relevant to the nutrition and food.

Students will be required to write specific aims for a grant proposal on a topic of the instructor’s choosing. A class on writing skills will help students form a clear and concise series of specific aims. A class on available citation databases and reference management techniques will guide students on effective literature searches and management of citations. The entire class will critique each set of specific aims in an interactive session. Thereafter, the student, working with his/her advisor if possible, will devise and write a research grant proposal using the format described below. During this time lectures will focus on specific topics relevant to grant writing. All will be encouraged to seek one-on-one assistance from participating statisticians while formulating the initial experimental design. Designated time outside of the classroom is required for each student to write a grant. The final grant will then be distributed to the entire class with advance time for the advisor, course instructors, and students to have time to read each grant, give feedback, and prepare questions. During the final weeks of the course, each student will defend their grant proposal in front of the class. Each student will be expected to explain to the class the formulated research question and the specific aims, and respond to questions and comments from the advisor, course instructors and other students. Throughout the course, case studies on responsible ethical conduct in research, including responsible peer-review, will be discussed to facilitate the student's’ development of ethical reasoning in research.

Faced with a death sentence, Socrates claimed that even the fear of death could not prevent him from doing what is right, offering as proof not words, but deeds. Taking Socrates' distinction between words and deeds, and focusing on the relationship between the arguments and the action, we will study the Laches, Symposium, Meno, Protagoras, and Republic, as well as the works recounting his last days, in an attempt to understand Plato's Socrates and his views regarding knowledge, virtue, justice, courage, and the care of one's soul.","showCourse":"Y","acad_career":"ASEU","course_title":"Plato's Socrates","level1_groupid":"1335920SA0000000","hasHiddenClasses":"N","comp_reqd_desc":"","course_num":"PHIL-0150","sections":[{"components":[{"unit_selected":1,"enrl_cart_stat":"N","section_num":"A-LEC","unit_min":1,"showClass":"Y","campus":"Medford/Somerville","class_stat":"A","session_desc":"SA","consent":"N","class_num":"50179","assoc_flag":"A","component":"Lecture","class_attr":"BFA-Humanities|BFA-Language/Culture|BFA-Social Science|Classical Culture/Language|LA-Distribution-Humanities|LA-Distribution-Social Sciences|SoE-HASS|SoE-HASS-Humanities|SoE-HASS-Social Sciences","grd_basis":"GRD","credit_select":"N","ssr_comp":"LEC","unit_max":1,"grd_desc":"GRD","locations":[{"myLocUniqueId":"PHIL-015050179A-LECM086_108","instructor":"Ioannis Evrigenis","campus":"Medford/Somerville","class_loc":"Olin Language Arts Ctr, Rm 108","meetings":[{"mtg_num":"1","meet_end_min":990,"days":["Tu","Th"],"meet_end":"4:30PM","meet_start_min":780,"meet_start":"1:00PM"}],"loc_id":"M086_108"}],"assoc_class":"1","selected":"","status":"O"}],"comp_desc":"Lecture"}]},{"desc_long":"Full-time.

Class time will be divided into demonstrations and supervised darkroom sessions.\nFocus: This class does not require that a student has any experience with photography or using a traditional darkroom. During this course students will develop their understanding of how a camera works and how to use the darkroom. There will be weekly demonstrations and assignments to teach students the necessary techniques to produce quality negatives and prints.
