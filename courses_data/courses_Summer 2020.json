As a means for developing your design skills, we will discuss the fundamental features of a high level, general purpose programming language — namely C++ — and learn how to use it as a tool for problem solving. We will also consider the performance of solutions, and how to apply both analytical and empirical assessment techniques. Finally, we will explore the Unix operating system as a context for problem solving. (Additional weekly lab time scheduled at first class meeting.)\r\nRecommendations: High school algebra.
