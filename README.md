# course_scheduler
Automatic course scheduler for Tufts which parses meeting times for classes copy-pasted from SIS, finds all the possible schedules for the given classes, removes those that do not specify a given criteria, e.g. classes cannot start before 9am, and then rates all the remaining schedules according to a given function, e.g. the sum of all durations of periods between classes which are say >= 30 minutes.
