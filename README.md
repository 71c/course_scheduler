# Tufts Course Scheduler

_NOTE_: Website is currently down due to Tufts recently changing its URLs for its API; this problem will be fixed when I have the time.

This is an automatic course scheduler website for Tufts University!
You can input your courses and preferences to generate possible schedules.
To run the server, install Git and Node.js, and enter
```
git clone https://github.com/71c/course_scheduler.git
cd course_scheduler
npm install
```
then enter `node .`.
